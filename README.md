Website Description
    My goal was to make a playful and fun version of my portfolio. The purpose here is to showcase my projects while also maintaining a light tone. In order to achieve this, I stuck with showing off only my sillier projects. Each project contains an image of the project and a brief description of what it entails. The name of the project can also be seen bouncing up and down. The projects live together in a brief gallery on the home page, and there is also an about page with some information about me.
    I tried to make the website interesting and engaging through the use of fun colors and fun animations. The entire background of the website is a moving color gradient and then hovering over different parts cause different animations. Such as the name flying out to sit below the pictures in the gallery when the user hovers over the image. I also added animations to the navigation bar that help indicate what page the user is on and when they’re hovering over to click a new page. My target audience here are peers who are interested in seeing fun projects that I’ve completed at CMU as well as any prospective employers who want to see my fun side.

Use of Website
•   From the homepage, click on about in the top right corner, it should underline when you hover. This will take you to the about page
•   From the homepage, scroll down and click on the image of the box, the name of the project should appear underneath when you hover. This will take you to the box project page
•   From the homepage, scroll down and click on the image of the bee, the name of the project should appear underneath when you hover. This will take you to the bee project page
•   Each page has a changing gradient that you can appreciate

External Libraries
    I primarily used bootstrap and various types of animations. I wanted to use bootstrap because my laptop has different dimensions than a standard laptop, so I wanted to ensure that all users can experience the website as I intended. I added animation because I wanted the website to be more fun, interactive, and experiential. I used bootstrap to make the gallery adjust automatically to the screen size. I used animations for all the backgrounds of each page and for some text boxes. These features add to my website by increasing usability, experience, and adding a tone. My intention is to create a fun and silly website, so I used the animations to help add to tone.

Iteration from Homework 7
    I iterated on my HW7 mockups quite a bit. Before I was hoping to recreate my portfolio with the same rather serious tone and idea behind my previous portfolio. As I implemented different animations, I decided to have more fun with my design and do things that I usually would not, such as the gradient background and the jumping titles. This completely changed the tone of my project and the goal. Rather than creating a formal portfolio, the idea now was a fun project to test new external libraries.
Major Challenges
    A major challenge I had was bootstrap. I was able to get it to work by changing the proportion of the gallery images, but I was unable to make it stack the way I wanted to. I also struggled a bit with the overall layout and making things arrange together nicely.
