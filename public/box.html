                    <p>We designed a large lofted and raised  weather resistant wooden anti-theft box designed to sit on a porch and prevent packages from being stolen. At the core of our box is a pressure sensor which serves to detect whether or not packages have been placed inside. Once a package has been placed, the device automatically locks and waits until its owner unlocks it with a key. In its unlocked state, the owner is able to not only collect their package(s) from inside, but can also recalibrate the package sensing in case it is no longer accurately detecting packages. Once the package has been taken out and/or the sensing has been recalibrated, the owner turns the key to set the device back into the ‘package detection’ state. The device is powered by four batteries found in a cubby below its floating base, and further doubles as a surface to put items on, allowing the owner to place bags on it while opening the front door. </p>
