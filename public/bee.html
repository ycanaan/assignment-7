                    <p>The intent of this project was to provide a voice to an inanimate object that is typically seen as a a source of comfort and support. This is meant to be spooky and unnerving as your trust is betrayed by the most unassuming object you own. The initial idea was for a stuffed animal to tweet where you are based off of longitude and latitude data, thus exposing to the world where you are at any given moment. </p>
                    <p>I was able to create a bee that tweeted whenever it was being moved. Using the accelerometer on the circuit playground bluefruit that was attached to the bee, the device communicated over bluetooth with my phone, which in turn communicated with the Adafruit IO website regarding whether there was a significant change in the accelerometer data. If there was, the data was transferred to IFTTT which then either sent a tweet or an email that the bee was being moved. By the final iteration, this processes worked rather seamlessly and quickly, with only a short delay between the movement of the bee and a tweet or email. </p>
